## 1. Introduction

The high copy number per cell, the stability against degradation and the
maternal mode of inheritance make the mitochondrial (mt) genome
particularly suitable for palaeo-, medical- and forensic genetic
investigations. Its increased evolutionary rate led to sequence
variation that has been generated by sequential accumulation of new
mutations along radiating maternal lineages during human dispersal into
different parts of the world.

Forensic molecular biology takes advantage of this variation for human
identity testing by sequence analysis of the (hypervariable segments
within the) mtDNA control region (CR). New developments in Massively
Parallel Sequencing (MPS) demonstrated that also full mtGenome
information can be obtained from even degraded forensic samples (Parson
et al 2013, Eduardoff et al 2017, Strobl et al 2018). MtDNA analysis is
a powerful tool to exclude samples as originating from the same
individual/matriline. If two samples cannot be excluded the significance
of the mtDNA match is assessed by making reference to the abundance of
that particular mtDNA sequence (= mitotype) in a relevant population.
