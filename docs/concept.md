## 2. Concept

The EMPOP database aims at the collection, quality control and
searchable presentation of mtDNA mitotypes from all over the world.
EMPOP has carefully been envisioned and designed as high quality mtDNA
database, where available primary sequence lane data are permanently
linked to the database entries. The scientific concept and the quality
control measures using logical and phylogenetic tools were found
suitable for forensic purposes, e.g. by a declaration of the [German
Supreme Court of Justice
(2010)](http://dl.empop.org/BGH-Urteil%20kombinierte%20DNA-Analyse.pdf),
the [SWGDAM mtDNA interpretation
guidelines](http://swgdam.org/SWGDAM%20mtDNA_Interpretation_Guidelines_APPROVED_073013.pdf)
(2013), and the [updated ISFG guidelines for mtDNA
analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117402) and
interpretation (2014).

The scientific contents presented in EMPOP were developed by the
[Institute of Legal Medicine (GMI)](http://www.gmi.eu), Medical
University of Innsbruck and the [Institute of Mathematics, University of
Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/index.html.de).

The mitotypes stored in EMPOP are not considered for partial or full
download. The concept of data quality management requires a centralized
supervision of the data. Necessary updates (e.g. haplogroup status,
Release updates) will be introduced by the database curators to ensure
continuous data quality and are made publicly available (see Release
history).
